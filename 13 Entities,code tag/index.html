    <!--HTML Entities
HTML entities are a crucial part of HTML markup language. They enable you to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily available on the keyboard. In this blog, we'll explore what HTML entities are, their types, and how to use them.

What Are HTML Entities?
HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Why Use HTML Entities?
Here are some reasons:

Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line.
Common HTML Entities-->
&lt;  for <
&gt;  for >
&amp; for &
&nbsp; for a non-breaking space
&copy; for ©
<h1><p>The price is 10 &lt; 20.</p></h1>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2023.</p>
<p>This is an example&nbsp;text.</p>
<pre>
    <p>This is a para</p>



    this is after few new lines         and some more 
    we can write anything and the pre tag can directly show accordung we write this is in a code

<!--What Are <blockquote> and <q> Tags?
The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML. While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes.

Why Use These Tags?
They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content.-->
<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/">
    Quotation text here.
  </blockquote>
  <q cite="source-url">Quotation text here.</q>
  <blockquote cite="https://example.com">
    This is a long quote from an external source. This quote can span multiple lines and paragraphs.
  </blockquote>
